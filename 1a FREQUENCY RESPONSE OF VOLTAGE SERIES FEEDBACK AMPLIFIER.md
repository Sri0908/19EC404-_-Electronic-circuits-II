## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | = 200 HZ| = 100 HZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 8 KHZ| = 12 KHZ|
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 78 KHZ\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 12.9 KHZ \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 16.70 dB\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 14.92 dB\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 10 dB | 7.8 dB  |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
